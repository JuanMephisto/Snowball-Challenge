          In more rural areas of the world, people can not afford school.
          Education is an important opertunity every child should have the
          right to carry. Therefore, we have created a solution.
        <br><br>Our solution consist of handing out radio systems to each
        family, if these devices can be made to consume little power a good
        solution can be to charge them by solar power if the area is without power.
        Right now, many children are without school in rural areas and any form of
        learning is better than no learning. The goal is to let every family
        have one of their own.</p>
